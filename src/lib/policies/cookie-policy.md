## **Cookies and Automated Trackers**

Cookies are small text files placed on your browser or device by websites you visit. Websites also use other automated means, such as pixel tags (also known as web beacons or clear GIFs).

There are two primary types of cookies:

- **First-party cookies**: Placed by the website you are visiting.
